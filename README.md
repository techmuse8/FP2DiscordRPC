A mod for Freedom Planet 2 that implements Discord Rich Presence support.
## Features
While playing the game, the following details will be displayed on your profile:

- Which character you are playing as and their appropriate icon (This even accounts for custom characters with the help of FP2Lib, though there will be a placeholder icon in said cases)
- What stage/hub you're in and it's appropriate stage icon
- If you are currently watching a cutscene
- The current menu you are in (i.e the world map in both Adventure and Classic Mode, the main menu, etc.)
